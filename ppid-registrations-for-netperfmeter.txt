## What type of assignment/registration are you requesting?
SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier for the NetPerfMeter Protocol (NPMP):
- PPID for Control Channel (NPMP-CONTROL)
- PPID for Data Channel (NPMP-DATA)

## Which registry are you requesting this assignment/registration be made in?
SCTP Parameters -> SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers


## If possible, please give a brief description of why you need this assignment/registration:
The NetPerfMeter Protocol (NPMP) is used by the NetPerfMeter application, a performance test and analysis tool for SCTP transmissions. NPMP uses a Control Channel over SCTP (NPMP-CONTROL) to set up test scenarios between two nodes. Performance tests are made over one or more Data Channels over SCTP (NPMP-DATA). In order to differentiate Control and Data Channel messages, two distinct SCTP PPIDs are needed.

The implementation of NetPerfMeter is available as Open Source under GPLv3 licence at:
