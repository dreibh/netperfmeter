## What type of assignment/registration are you requesting?
DCCP Service Code for the NetPerfMeter Protocol on the Data Channel (NPMP-DATA)

## Which registry are you requesting this assignment/registration be made in?
DCCP Parameters -> Service Codes

## If possible, please give a brief description of why you need this assignment/registration:
The NetPerfMeter Protocol (NPMP) is used by the NetPerfMeter application, a performance test and analysis tool for DCCP transmissions. NPMP uses a Control Channel over SCTP (NPMP-CONTROL) to set up test scenarios between two nodes. DCCP performance tests are made over one or more Data Channels over DCCP (NPMP-DATA). In order to identify the service (NPMP-DATA), the registration of a DCCP Service Code for the NPMP-DATA is needed.

The implementation of NetPerfMeter is available as Open Source under GPLv3 licence at:
