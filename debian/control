Description: Network Performance Meter (measurement program)
 NetPerfMeter is a network performance meter for the UDP,
 TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.
 It simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint
 and measures the resulting flow bandwidths and QoS. The
 results are written as vector and scalar files. The vector
 files can e.g. be used to create plots of the results.
 .
 This package contains the measurement program.

 It simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint
 and measures the resulting flow bandwidths and QoS. The
 results are written as vector and scalar files. The vector
 files can e.g. be used to create plots of the results.

Description: Network Performance Meter (server service)
 NetPerfMeter is a network performance meter for the UDP,
 TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.
 It simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint
 and measures the resulting flow bandwidths and QoS. The
 results are written as vector and scalar files. The vector
 files can e.g. be used to create plots of the results.
 .
 This package sets up a service running a NetPerfMeter
 server instance.

Description: PDF Processing Tools
 This package contains tools for PDF file processing.
 .
 SetPDFMetadata updates the metadata of a PDF file. In particular, it can be
 used to add outlines (bookmarks) to a document. Furthermore, it can set the
 document properties (e.g. author, title, keywords, creator, producer).
 .
 PDFEmbedFonts embeds all referenced fonts into a PDF file. Optionally, it
 can also linearize the PDF file for online publication
 ("fast web view", "optimized").
