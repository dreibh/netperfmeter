Description: Network Performance Meter (measurement program)
 NetPerfMeter is a network performance meter for the TCP, MPTCP, SCTP, UDP,
 and DCCP transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6. It simultaneously transmits
 bidirectional flows to an endpoint and measures the resulting flow bandwidths
 and QoS. Flows can be saturated (i.e. “send as much as possible”) or
 non-saturated with frame rate and frame sizes (like a multimedia
 transmission). Non-saturated flows can be configured with constant or
 variable frame rate/frame size, i.e. to realise Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or
 Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. For both, frame rate and frame size, it is
 not only possible to set constant values but to also to use random
 distributions. Furthermore, flows can be set up as on/off flows. Of course,
 the flow parameters can be configured individually per flow and flow
 direction. The measurement results can be recorded as scalar files (summary
 of the run) and vector files (time series). These files can be processed
 further, e.g. for detailed analysis and plotting of the results. The
 Wireshark network protocol analyser provides out-of-the-box support for
 analysing NetPerfMeter packet traffic.
 .
 This package contains the measurement program.

Description: PDF Processing Tools
 This package contains tools for PDF file processing.
 .
 SetPDFMetadata updates the metadata of a PDF file. In particular, it can be
 used to add outlines (bookmarks) to a document. Furthermore, it can set the
 document properties (e.g. author, title, keywords, creator, producer).
 .
 PDFEmbedFonts embeds all referenced fonts into a PDF file. Optionally, it
 can also linearize the PDF file for online publication
 ("fast web view", "optimized").
