1. "Strange SCTP association breaks"

If active and passive instances only have private addresses, and e.g. docker.io is installed:
Both instances have interface virbr0 with 192.168.122.1 => SCTP assumes it is talking to the
own machine, causing an ABORT of the association (OOTB handling).

=> Not a bug of NetPerfMeter/SCTP.

Possible solutions/work-arounds:
- Remove virbr0, or configure unique IP ranges per device
- Make sure the machine(s) have at least a global address
