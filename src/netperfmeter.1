.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm netperfmeter
is a network performance meter for the UDP, TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP
transport protocols. It simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an
endpoint and measures the resulting flow bandwidths. The results are written
as vector and scalar files.
.Pp
.\" ###### Arguments ########################################################
.Sh ARGUMENTS
The following arguments have to be provided:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Port
The port number for the passive side's data socket. The port number of the control socket will be port+1. Specifying a port number turns netperfmeter in passive mode, i.e. it will wait for incoming connections.
.It Destination:Port
Specifies the destination endpoint to connect to. This will turn netperfmeter in active mode, i.e. it will connect to the specified remote endpoint.
.It Fl control-over-tcp
Use TCP instead of SCTP for the control connection. This is useful for NAT traversal.
.It Fl local=Address[,Address,...]
Specifies address(es) of the local *data* endpoint. For TCP, UDP and DCCP, only the first address is used!
On an active node, this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set before specifying a flow!
.It Fl controllocal=Address[,Address,...]
Specifies address(es) of the local *control* endpoint (SCTP or TCP). For TCP, only the first address is used!
.It Fl runtime
Specifies the measurement runtime in seconds. After the given time span, netperfmeter will finish the measurement.
.It Fl config=Name
Specifies the name of the configuration file to write. Default is output.config.
.It Fl vector=Name
Specifies the name pattern of the vector files to write. If the suffix of this name is .bz2, the file will be BZip2-compressed on the fly. The vector name is automatically extended to name the flow vector files by adding -<active|passive>-<flow_id>-<stream_id> before the suffix.
Default is vector.vec.bz2, hence the name of the vector file for flow 5, stream 2 on the passive node will be vector-passive-00000005-0002.vec.bz2.
.It Fl scalar=Name
Specifies the name pattern of the scalar files to write. If the suffix of this name is .bz2, the file will be BZip2-compressed on the fly. The scalar name is automatically extended to name the flow scalar files by adding -<active|passive>-<flow_id>-<stream_id> before the suffix.
Default is scalar.vec.bz2, hence the name of the scalar file for flow 5, stream 2 on the passive node will be scalar-passive-00000005-0002.vec.bz2.
.It Fl activenodename=Description
Sets a textual description of the active node (e.g. Client).
.It Fl passivenodename=Description
Sets a textual description of the passive node (e.g. Server).
.It Fl quiet
Reduces verbosity of log output. May be specified multiple times.
.It Fl verbose
Increases verbosity of log output. May be specified multiple times.
.It Fl verbosity=Level
Sets the verbosity of the log output to a given level, from 0 (lowest) to 6 (highest).
.It Fl display
Display live I/O statistics, updated every second. This is enabled by default.
.It Fl nodisplay
No not display live I/O statistics. This is useful for running NetPerfMeter in background as a service.
.It Fl v6only
Use sockets with IPv6 only (by setting IPV6_V6ONLY socket option).
.It Fl pathmgr=name
Set MPTCP path manager for the passive node (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
On an active node, this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set before specifying a flow!
.It Fl scheduler=name
Set MPTCP scheduler for the passive node (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
On an active node, this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set before specifying a flow!
.It rcvbuf=bytes
Sets the receiver buffer size (on the listening socket) to the given number of bytes.
.It sndbuf=bytes
Sets the sender buffer size (on the listening socket) to the given number of bytes.
.It Fl sctp
Establish a new SCTP association. The streams of this association must be specified by one or more FLOWSPEC specifications as following parameters.
.It Fl tcp
Establish a new TCP or MPTCP connection. The flow of this connection must be specified by a FLOWSPEC specification as following parameter. MPTCP support in NetPerfMeter is realized as additional "MPTCP" socket (i.e. another TCP socket, but bound to another port number and with CMT enabled). That is, for MPTCP usage, it must contain the option cmt=mptcp (see below) to usage the MPTCP socket instead of the TCP socket.
.It Fl udp
Establish a new UDP connection. The flow of this connection must be specified by a FLOWSPEC specification as following parameter.
.It Fl dccp
Establish a new DCCP connection. The flow of this connection must be specified by a FLOWSPEC specification as following parameter. Note, that DCCP is not available on all platforms yet. Currently, only Linux provides DCCP in its official kernel.
.It FLOWSPEC
Specifies a new flow. The format is: outgoing_frame_rate:outgoing_frame_size:incoming_frame_rate:incoming_frame_size:option:...
The first four parameters (outgoing_frame_rate:outgoing_frame_size:incoming_frame_rate:incoming_frame_size:option) may be substituted by the option "default", creating a flow with some more or less useful default parameters.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It outgoing_frame_rate
The frame rate of the outgoing transfer (i.e. active node to passive node). If set to const0, the sender will be saturarted, i.e. it will try to send as much as possible.
.It outgoing_frame_size
The frame size of the outgoing transfer (i.e. active node to passive node). If set to const0, there will be *no* data transmission in this direction.
.It incoming_frame_rate
The frame rate of the incoming transfer (i.e. passive node to active node). See outgoing_frame_rate for details.
.It incoming_frame_size
The frame size of the incoming transfer (i.e. active node to passive node). See outgoing_frame_size for details.
.It Possible options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It id=Flow Identifier
Sets an ID number for the flow. The IDs within a measurement must be unique!
.It description=Description
Sets a textual description of the flow (e.g. HTTP-Flow). Do not use spaces in the description!
.It maxmsgsize=Bytes
Splits frames into messages of at most the given number of bytes. Messages may not exceed 65535 bytes.
.It defragtimeout=Milliseconds
Messages not received within this timeout after the last successfully received message are accounted as lost. NOTE: this also happens if the transport protocol is reliable and the message is actually received later!
.It unordered=Fraction
Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in unordered mode (SCTP only).
.It ordered=Fraction
Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in ordered mode (SCTP only).
.It reliable=Fraction
Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in reliable mode (SCTP only).
.It unreliable=Fraction
Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in unreliable mode (SCTP only).
.It rtx_timeout=Milliseconds
Sets the retransmission timeout for unreliable messages (SCTP only; not available on all platforms!)
.It rtx_trials=Trials
Sets the retransmission trials for unreliable messages (SCTP only; not available on all platforms!)
.It rcvbuf=Bytes
Sets the receiver buffer size to the given number of bytes.
.It sndbuf=Bytes
Sets the sender buffer size to the given number of bytes.
.It onoff=t1,t2,...[,repeat]
A list of time stamps when the flow should be activated or deactivated. If onoff is given, the flow is off at startup. At t1, it will be turned on; at t2, it will be turned off, etc.. Time stamps can be given as absolute values (e.g. onoff=0,10,30 - to turn on at t=0, turn off at t=10 and turn on again at t=30 until end of measurement) or relative values (e.g. on=10,+30,+60 - to turn on at t=10, turn off at t=40 and turn on again at t=100 until end of measurement).
A repetition of the list is possible with the keyword "repeat" at the end of the list. Then, all values need to be relative values and the number of items must be even.
.It error_on_abort=on|off
By default, the active side stops with an error when a transmission tails (e.g. on connection abort). This parameter turns this behaviour on or off.
.It nodelay=on|off
Deactivate Nagle algorithm (TCP and SCTP only; default: off).
.It debug=on|off
Set debug mode on socket (currently: MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
.It ndiffports=number
Set number of different MPTCP subflows (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
.It Fl v6only
Use socket with IPv6 only (by setting IPV6_V6ONLY socket option).
.It pathmgr=name
Set MPTCP path manager (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
.It scheduler=name
Set MPTCP scheduler (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel patch!).
.It cc=name
Set congestion control name (TCP and MPTCP for Linux only).
.It cmt=off|cmt|cmtrpv1|cmtrpv2|like-mptcp|mptcp-like|mptcp
Configures usage of Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT): off (turned off; default), cmt (independent paths), cmtrpv1 (CMT/RPv1), cmtrpv1 (CMT/RPv2), mptcp/like-mptcp/mptcp-like (MPTCP), 0-255 (custom value).
Currently only supported by CMT-SCTP on FreeBSD systems and MPTCP on Linux systems. Note: CMT for MPTCP always uses MPTCP congestion control.
